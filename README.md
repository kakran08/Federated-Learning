# Federated Learning
It is kind of distributed learning.

It ensures privacy preservation.

Model is trained at local devices which may include mobile devices, IoT devices etc.

Model parameters are shared to central server where central server manages aggregation of weights into global model weights.

Global model weights are synced with distributed devices after each update in global model weights.
